# Polyglot Codebase Knowledge Graph

> Generated offline by **readmenator**. 2 files, 2 symbols, 3 imports. Supports C, C++, Python, Go, Rust, JS/TS, Java, C#, Shell, PHP, Dart, GDScript, Nim, ASM, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, Lua, Elixir.
> No LLMs. No tokens. Pure static analysis. See more [here](https://github.com/grisuno/ReadMenator)

**Start here:** Statistics Dashboard for scope, God Nodes for blast radius, Architecture Reference for per-file API. Agents: prefer `readmenator-agent/INDEX.md` + `SYMBOLS.md`.

**Total Files Parsed:** 2 | **Total Symbols Extracted:** 2 | **Total Imports:** 3

## Statistics Dashboard

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Files | 2 |
| Total Symbols | 2 |
| Total Imports | 3 |
| Call Edges | 15 |
| Inheritance Edges | 0 |
| Languages | 2 |
| Avg Symbols/File | 1.0 |
| Avg Imports/File | 1.5 |

### Top Files by Import Count (Fan-Out)

| File | Imports | Symbols | Language |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| `app.py` | 3 | 2 | py |

---

## Architectural Layers

Auto-detected from path patterns, naming conventions, and imported frameworks.

| Layer | Files |
|-------|-------|
| presentation | 1 |
| utility | 1 |

### presentation

- `app.py` (py, 2 symbols)

### utility

- `install.sh` (sh, 0 symbols)

---

## Ranked Context

Files ranked by composite score for the current query context. The ranking combines Personalized PageRank (query relevance), global authority, test coverage, documentation coverage, and code freshness. Model: v1.0.

| Rank | File | Composite | PPR | Authority | Test | Doc |
|------|------|-----------|-----|-----------|------|-----|
| 1 | `app.py` | 0.0500 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.00 | 0.50 |
| 2 | `install.sh` | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.00 | 0.00 |

---

## God Nodes

Most architecturally central files ranked by combined import/export degree and symbol richness.

| File | Score | Connections | PageRank |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `app.py` | 0.2 | | 0.0000 |
| `install.sh` | 0.0 | | 0.0000 |

---

## Suggested Questions

Auto-generated exploration prompts based on graph structure:

- What does app.py depend on, and what depends on it? (0 connections)
- What does install.sh depend on, and what depends on it? (0 connections)
- What is the overall architecture of this codebase?

---

## Taint Propagation Map

Taint analysis traces how dangerous imports propagate through the codebase via transitive dependencies. Source files import dangerous modules directly; sink files receive the danger indirectly.

**Taint Sources:** 1 | **Taint Sinks:** 1 | **Propagation Paths:** 1

- `app.py` imports `requests` (0 hop to `app.py`) [medium]
  Path: app.py

---

## Hotspot Analysis

Files ranked by combined complexity (symbol count) and centrality (connection count). High-scoring files are architecturally critical and may need refactoring attention.

| File | Complexity | Centrality | Combined | Symbols | Connections |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `app.py` | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 2 | 3 |
| `install.sh` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 | 0 |

---

## Change Impact Analysis

Files sorted by how many other files would be affected if they changed. High-impact files should be changed with caution.

| File | Direct Dependents | Transitive Dependents | Total Impact |
|------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| `app.py` | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `install.sh` | 0 | 0 | 0 |

---

## Orphans

Files with no documentation or low connectivity. These are candidates for documentation investment or cleanup.

- `install.sh` (0 symbols, no doc)

---

## Query Recipes

Example queries you can run against this knowledge base using the ranking engine:

```
# Find files most relevant to a concept
readmenator query "Where is the import resolver implemented?"

# Rank files by relevance to a topic
readmenator query "How does documentation generation work?"

# Explain why a file ranks highly
readmenator query "explain readmenator/_documentation.py"

# Trace dependency paths with ranked context
readmenator query "path from CLI to exporter"
```

The ranking model uses the following signals:

- **Personalized PageRank** (45% weight): query-specific relevance via seed propagation
- **Global Authority** (20% weight): structural importance via standard PageRank
- **Test Coverage** (15% weight): fraction of symbols referenced in test files
- **Doc Coverage** (10% weight): presence of docstrings and file-level docs
- **Freshness** (10% weight): recent modification activity

Results include score decomposition and justification paths for each ranked item.

## Code Property Graph

Machine-readable Code Property Graph (CPG) in JSON-LD format. This block allows AI agents to parse the full structural graph without additional file reads. Compatible with GraphRAG pipelines.
